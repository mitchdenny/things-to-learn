#Things to Learn

This is a list of things (in software engineering) that I think are worth learning. I've learned some of them, others are just reminders that I need to learn them sometime.

##Android

Here are some things that you need to be across when doing native Android development.

- Activities;
- Intents;
- PendingIntents;
  - [SDK Documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html)
- Layouts;
- Menus;
- Fragments;
- [Gradle](http://www.gradle.com); is a build automation tool used in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) (among other things).
- [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/); is a dynamic language that runs on top of the JVM and us used by Gradle.

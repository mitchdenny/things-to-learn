#Things to Learn

This is a list of things (in software engineering) that I think are worth learning. I've learned some of them, others are just reminders that I need to learn them sometime.

- [Gradle](http://www.gradle.com); is a build automation tool used in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) (among other things).
- [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/); is a dynamic language that runs on top of the JVM and us used by Gradle.
